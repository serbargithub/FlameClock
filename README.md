This is a hobby project that is ongoing.
The goal is development of a device with graphical gas-discharge indicator. 
This type of indicators were popular about 30 years ago, 
and now are usually used for handmade devices with vintage style.
This one will be a clock with various stylish screens on the display, alarms, and perhaps an animation.
You can find a few pictures in DOC/PIC folder to understand how it looks like and works at this moment.
